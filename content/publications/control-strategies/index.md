##### Abstract

Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (sCO2) Brayton cycles combine the low thermal inertia of air gas turbine cycles with the high efficiency of steam Rankine cycles. Over the past two decades, research interest in these cycles has grown significantly, covering system design optimization, component-level studies, and diverse applications. Power control remains an active research area, given the suitability of sCO2 cycles for dispatchable power generation, waste heat recovery, and long-duration energy storage. This study compares various control strategies proposed for these cycles, examining both conventional approaches and novel schemes specific to closed gas cycles. In particular, the potential of compressor speed control in conjunction with different strategies is emphasized, addressing a key research gap in load regulation.

The results indicate that while inventory control remains the most efficient strategy, compressor speed control enables storage tank size optimization. Although turbine throttling is ineffective in closed gas cycles, the turbine-bypass strategy benefits significantly from compressor control. Similarly, turbine inlet parameter control also sees performance improvements when coupled with compressor control. Part-load performance is evaluated using detailed component modeling and realistic component interactions, providing a comprehensive assessment of control strategies for load regulation in sCO2 cycles.
