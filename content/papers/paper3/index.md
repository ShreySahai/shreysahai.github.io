##### Abstract

Using several case studies, this paper describes the inner hedgehog, a psychological condition widespread in academic occupations. The condition has lasting consequences and no known cure. Mauris tincidunt quam a libero consequat, nec pharetra nunc tristique. Pellentesque eget ipsum ut dui laoreet congue ut nec nulla. Nulla facilisi. Sed consequat, odio ac aliquet tempor, turpis augue auctor mauris, at malesuada sem dolor eget libero. Nullam iaculis malesuada risus, id fringilla quam sagittis ac. Fusce congue vel ex et facilisis. Integer volutpat eros ut urna efficitur, id efficitur sapien pharetra.
